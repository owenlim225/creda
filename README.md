# Introduction

## Overview

Creda is a loyalty and rewards infrastructure for Web3 that supports Aptos-based projects with **user retention** and **community growth** via on-chain rewards. As a lightweight campaign and rewards engine, it enables projects to launch loyalty programs, distribute tokens or NFTs, and monitor user engagement with minimal tech setup.&#x20;

Developers can also incorporate custom reward systems into their dApps using **Creda's SDK** and **API**. Furthermore, Creda enables interoperability between Aptos-based projects registered within its platform, facilitating seamless integration and collaboration. Users can complete in-app actions to earn points redeemable for NFTs, exclusive perks, unlockable content, and other partner rewards, enhancing their experience within the ecosystem.



## Purpose

Creda strives to solve one of the hardest problems in Web3â€”user retention. It is common for many projects to get eyes on them with hype or an airdrop but very few retain long-term loyalty. With the no-code campaign engine, Creda offers campaign creation tools with on-chain loyalty tracking, incentive repeat engagements, and transparent loyalty tracking.

With a no-code campaign engine, SDK/API integrations, and cross-project point redemption, Creda empowers both technical and non-technical teams to drive user engagement.
