# Why Creda?

## **Reimagining Loyalty Through On-Chain Actions**

Creda was built to solve a major gap in Web3: the lack of sustainable, on-chain user retention. In an ecosystem saturated with vanity metrics and airdrop hunters, Creda introduces a smarter infrastructure—rewarding genuine engagement through verifiable blockchain activity. It enables projects to run loyalty campaigns that are transparent, scalable, and deeply integrated into the user journey.

## **Core Advantages**

### ★ **On-Chain Retention, Not Just Reach**

Unlike platforms focused on social quests or off-chain engagement, Creda zeroes in on verifiable, on-chain behavior. Whether it's minting, staking, or holding, actions matter—and Creda turns them into loyalty currency.

## ★ **Cross-Ecosystem Reward Portability**

Creda points aren’t siloed. Users can earn from one campaign and redeem across other partnered projects, NFTs, gated content, or even real-world perks. It’s a shared loyalty layer for all Web3.



## ★ **Zero Dev Work to Launch Campaigns**

With Creda’s prebuilt campaign templates and smart contracts, teams can go live instantly—no need to build, deploy, or audit their own logic.



## ★ **Flexible SDK & API for Builders**

For apps that want deeper integration, Creda offers plug-and-play developer tools to track activity, distribute rewards, and build custom point experiences.



## ★ **Unified Loyalty Infrastructure**

Creda serves as the backend that connects projects, users, and rewards—ensuring every point earned and redeemed is secure, auditable, and frictionless.



## ★ **Proof-of-Value for Real Ecosystem Growth**

By aligning incentives across projects, Creda helps networks like Aptos or any EVM chain build not just activity, but loyalty loops that last beyond token inflation.

**In short:**\
Creda isn’t just a points engine—it’s a Web3-native loyalty protocol designed to make retention infrastructure as composable, trusted, and scalable as DeFi.
