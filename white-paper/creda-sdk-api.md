  Distribute project tokens or Creda Points via our battle-tested smart contracts—no need to deploy your own.
* **Predefined Campaign Templates**\
  Launch reward-based missions instantly (e.g., “Hold for 7 days”, “Mint + Stake”, “Trade 3x”) with easy-to-use templates.
* **Custom Campaign Creation (Advanced)**\
  For advanced builders, use our SDK to define unique logic, conditions, and reward multipliers.
* **RESTful API & Webhooks**\
  Integrate user point balances, reward redemptions, and leaderboard data into your frontend or dashboards in real-time.

  Earned points don’t end in one app—Creda’s SDK lets you offer redemption options across multiple ecosystems.
