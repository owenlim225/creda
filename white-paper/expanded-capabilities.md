# Expanded Capabilities

## **On-Chain Loyalty Infrastructure**

Creda provides a campaign engine built for on-chain activity tracking. Unlike existing platforms that rely heavily on social proof or off-chain interaction, Creda specializes in tracking wallet actions across dApps (staking, minting, swapping, etc.) to incentivize real usage and product engagement.

***

## **Cross-Project Reward Portability**

Users aren’t limited to rewards within a single app. Creda enables users to earn ecosystem-wide loyalty points from one campaign, then redeem across other partnered platforms—whether for exclusive perks, NFTs, or offers—creating a bridge of incentives across apps.

***

## **Plug-and-Play Campaign Templates**

To simplify setup, Creda offers predefined campaign templates. Partners don’t need to worry about contract development or custom logic—Creda handles the complexity. In the future, partners will have the flexibility to define their own campaign parameters.

***

## **Developer-Friendly SDK & API**

Creda’s SDK and API allow seamless integration of loyalty mechanics into any dApp. Partners can start rewarding on-chain behavior without reinventing backend systems or changing user flow.

***

## **Multichain-Ready Foundation**

While Creda begins on Aptos, its architecture is built with multichain deployment in mind—scaling reward interoperability beyond a single ecosystem.
