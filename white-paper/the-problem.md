# The problem

Web3 projects face a major challenge after user acquisition: keeping users engaged and loyal. While airdrops and quests bring traffic, they rarely translate into lasting retention. Core issues include:



## Lack of Retention Infrastracture

Most ecosystems focus on user acquisition but lack a system to **measure, reward, and sustain loyalty** over time.

***

## **Fragmented Loyalty Systems**

Projects are forced to build custom reward mechanics from scratch—leading to inconsistent UX, duplicated effort, and no shared loyalty standard across dApps.

***

## **Short-Term Incentive Loops**

Airdrops, quests, and campaigns often attract **farming behavior**, not real loyalty. Once rewards stop, so do the users.

***

## **Technical Complexity for Builders**

Implementing loyalty features (point systems, NFT perks, redeemable rewards) requires **custom contracts**, backend logic, and maintenance—distracting teams from core product development.

***

## **No Interoperability Across Projects**

Users can’t carry their engagement or loyalty across apps—every project is a silo. There’s **no cross-project reward portability**, limiting user retention on a larger ecosystem level.
