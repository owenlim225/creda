***

## **Plug-and-Play Loyalty Engine**

Creda offers a developer-friendly **SDK and API** that allows projects to easily integrate **custom reward systems**, track user behavior, and launch on-chain loyalty campaigns in minutes.



## **On-Chain Reward Portability**

Users earn **Creda Points** or project-specific tokens by interacting with integrated dApps—and can redeem them across ecosystem partners for **NFTs, perks, unlockable content, or governance rights**.



## **Behavior-Based Incentives**

Unlike one-off quests, Creda tracks **recurring user actions** (e.g., usage, holding, referrals), helping projects **reward actual loyalty**, not just short-term attention.



## **Campaign Layer for Retention**

Projects can launch **on-chain campaigns** with reward pools, leaderboards, and customizable logic—all managed from a simple dashboard or API.



## **Shared Loyalty Standard**

Creda creates a network effect across projects—users build loyalty in one app and unlock value in another, enabling **interoperability of retention** across the ecosystem.
